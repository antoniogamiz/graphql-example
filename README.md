# Manga Information API

I'm going to implement an API to handle information about mangas. This include things like genres, authors, publications, and whatever adds complexity to the project and it's useful to learn more about GraphQL. At the time of writing this, I know nothing about it so follow the commit history to see the progress ðŸ˜ƒ.
